# CoderFAV

The none stop awesome Coder editor for the web. I have been working with Dart and
wanted to build an editor for it. This isn't quite finished but it also supports other Web languages like
HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. If you didn't notice it this project is based on Codemirror.  I will be keeping you updated. Look below for updates
